Nano Coating information - Ceramics, Glass & Polished Marble surfaces.

NANO-COATINGS BASED ON SILICON DIOXIDE 
FOR GLASS AND GLAZED CERAMIC 

These non-stick coatings were designed to enable smooth, glass-like surfaces to have less contact with dirt particles. The hydro- and oleophobic effects cause particles of contamination such as grease, oil , lime and materials from environmental pollution to adhere less to the substrates, and allow them to be easily removed from the water repellent coating, i.e. without applying abrasive agents ("Easy-clean" effect). 

Examples of use: 

Glass surfaces in sanitary areas (showers, mirrors) 

Glazed ceramic surfaces (toilets, sinks, glazed tiles) 

Window glass + construction glass (conservatories, high-rise buildings) 

Automotive glass (front + side windows) 

Product characteristics: 

Strong hydrophobicity 

Strong anti-stick properties 

Excellent easy--clean performance on contamination and lime-scale 

Other properties: 

Food-safe (inert)
Invisible to the human eye (coating thickness: 100-150 nm)
Permanent (UV-stable, enormous abrasion-resistance) 

Resistant to temperature change 

Chemical-resistant (except for pH value of 13 or 14) 

ADVANTAGES OF EASY-CLEAN NANO-COATINGS, BASED ON SILICON DIOXIDE IN COMPARISON WITH COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS:
Permanence and longevity: 

UV-stability enables functionality for a number of years, approximately the lifetime of the coated surface.  Many competitive products are damaged slowly by sunlight
Abrasion-resistant easy--clean effect. 

A permanent chemical bond with the substrate enables excellent abrasion resistance
Many competitive products can be easily removed by abrasion
Chemical stability. 

The product is resistant to almost all standard household and industrial cleaners (with the exception of concentrated lye)
Many competitive products must be reapplied after cleaning the surface.
